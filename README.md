## Portfolio 2.0

The goal of recreating this project is build on and further my understanding of JavaScript React. The aim is to create a dynamic portfolio that showcase and demonstrate my work as I develop and complete them.

### Overview

For this recreation, I will primarily use JavaScript React and SCSS modules with BEM language conventions for my styling. Further to this, I will also move forward with a stronger approach to a mobile first design to accommodate the vastly increased use of mobile devices to desktop computers.

As I grow as an artist and a junior software developer, the goal for this project is to refine and develop with better code - readable, modular and organized.

### Criteria

As this is a recreation, the criteria will remain the same 
- landing page with name and title 
- about page 
- tech badges of acquired skills 
- project cards with further info modal 
- contact page with my links 
  - email 
  - Github profile 
  - LinkedIn profile
